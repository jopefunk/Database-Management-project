Introduction

Erkki Jokela, who is the head of a big market,needs to keep track of employees, their salaries and contact information. He has been trying to work with papers, and write everything down when something changed. After a few weeks he got already sick of it, so he asked our team to help him. So, our job was to build a database for a market that keeps track on employees and managers. 
The market itself is the base and is divided into sectors that include salesmen. 
All of the salesmen have managers, and the managers have managers, except for the head of the whole market. 
So the relationship between salesmen and managers is one-to-many, because a manager can lead many employees, 
but one salesman can have only one manager. Many salesmen can work on different sectors, and the sectors 
include many salesmen, so it is a many-to-many relationship.
