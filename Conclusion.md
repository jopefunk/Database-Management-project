Conclusion
--------------

We created a database that a market can use for keeping track on its employees. Employees are devided into salesmen and managers. Salesmen and managers work on departments. A salesman's manager is predetermined by on which department he or she works on, every department having only one manager. Also managers have managers, except the head of the whole market. 

In our case we have created the database according to the wishes of our customer, Erkki Jokela. His work gets easier, when he can use a database on a computer, rather than managing employees and managers on paper.

Although we have created this database according to Erkki Jokela's wishes, the model can also be adabted to meet other purposes and thus be used for other projects. The database structure is quite simple, which makes it easy for also other programmers to understand it.

During this project we have learned about the basics of database design and how to use our new skills in practice. We believe that we can use these skills in the future school projects and in work life.
